# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to STDD Copilot will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Skill Graph Engine**: Dynamic DAG orchestration with intent-adaptive topology (hotfix/feature/repair/research)
- **40+ CLI Commands**: Full workflow automation (init, new, apply, verify, archive, mutation, etc.)
- **Constitution System**: 9 articles with Hook Enforcement and waiver tracking
- **Ralph Loop TDD**: Red → Green → Refactor cycle with phase enforcement
- **5-Level Defense System**: Human confirmation gates, micro-task isolation, failure rollback, static quality, mutation review
- **Graph Runtime Modules**: Dynamic router, executor with self-healing, evidence capture, error propagator, heterogeneous adapter, parallel executor
- **Multi-Agent Runtime**: Party Mode state machine, SudoLang parser/executor
- **Browser Automation**: Built-in Playwright integration for E2E testing
- **Workspace/Monorepo Support**: Registry, scope detection, per-package commands
- **Mutation Testing**: Quick heuristic mode + Stryker delegation
- **Evidence Capture**: Structured error evidence with multi-hop propagation
- **22 AI Engine Adapters**: 4-Tier compatibility system
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Baseline metrics for core operations
- **TypeScript Type Definitions**: JSDoc types for core interfaces
- **Command Registry**: Centralized command management for dynamic loading
- **Error Handling**: Structured error codes, retry wrappers, evidence logging
- **Session Progress Tracking** (`stdd progress`): Real-time JSONL progress log for all CLI commands, survives terminal close/crash, supports breakpoint resume via `--resume`, SIGINT/SIGTERM signal capture, automatic truncation at 5000 entries
- **Logging System**: Multi-level structured logging with rotation

### Changed
- **apply.js/verify.js**: Extracted `getConfigTestCommand()` to shared module (`test-command-resolver.js`)
- **graph-executor.js**: Restored noop fallback with `shouldFailOn` simulation support
- **CI/CD**: Added Node.js 18/20/22 matrix testing

### Fixed
- Graph executor self-healing now preserves `_healingMeta` during rollback
- Integration tests aligned with actual CLI error messages
- `new change` now creates valid tasks.md with sample tasks

### Security
- Path traversal protection in change name validation
- Directory traversal prevention in file operations
- Command injection prevention via `spawnSync`
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- Initial public release
- Basic CLI commands (init, new, apply, verify, archive)
- Skill definitions for 5-phase workflow
- Constitution system foundation
- Graph engine foundation
